# PartyBus CheckIn Rails App!

The PartyBus CheckIn is a simple **Rails 3** app that allows hosts from the [Boomerang PartyBus](http://ridetheboomerang.com/ "Boomerang Party bus") to chekin guests when they arrive to the meeting point right before they board the bus and then party begins!

*Why I worte this app?*  
We usually have a printed sheet of paper with the unordered names of our guests. The problem with that is that is a slow and old-fashioned way to check people in, since most of the times we spent a lot of time searching for 1 name in a list of 150+ names. I notice this problem and I thought that it will be really useful for a Party bus Host like me, to just take out my mobile phone and load up this app, then I can just ask for the guest name, search it and click a link to check them in. That's it. It's easy, convenient and looks more professional.  


*Why I'm proud*  
I'm proud of this simple app because it makes my work as a host more easy and fun! It's awesome to listen to guests asking me: "Oh.. are you checkin me with your mobile phone? That's cool, which app is that? did you download it from the App Store?" :)
